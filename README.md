# tair_pubmed_connector
There is no function to fetch automatically the information on the reported pubmed articles links in the tair to be used for the language models, so i coded this function which will take the tair information, a gene or locus tag and will fetch the corresponding pubmed and then from the pubmed the corresponding abstracts
